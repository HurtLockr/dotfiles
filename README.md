# HurtLockr's dotfiles

These are the dotfiles from my current Arch/i3 setup. Don't have a defined install procedure, but I will write one in the future. 

Dotfiles maintained using [Yet Another Dotfiles Manager](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm)

This is the development branch, which is where I do all my messing around. I merge this onto master when I am mostly sure that I like my config.

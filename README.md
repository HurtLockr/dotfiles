# HurtLockr's dotfiles

These are the dotfiles from my current Arch/i3 setup. Don't have a defined install procedure, but I will write one in the future. 

Dotfiles maintained using [Yet Another Dotfiles Manager] (https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm)

The master branch is the stable one, and the devel branch is the one where I try stuff. I merge devel onto master when I'm done messing with particular parts of my configuration.
